One of them, named aureocyclicin 4185, is encoded on plasmid pRJ101 and seems to be a cyclic peptide, the first one described in staphylococci. Most of pRJ101 sequence was previously determined, except for ~100 bp, with a strong secondary structure. As pRJ101 does not carry genes involved in regulation of bacteriocin production, these genes might be encoded on the chromosome. Therefore, sequencing of the bacterial genome was expected: (i) to help to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of pRJ101, and to contribute to finding (ii) the regulatory genes involved in aureocyclicin 4185 production and/or (iii) a second bacteriocin gene cluster.",2017-11-23 02:33:15.668,2017-11-23 02:33:15.668,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"GCA_002374075.1_ASM237407v1_genomic",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Pubmed ID: 23270620. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for understanding both patterns of descent over time and space (phylogeography) and the molecular processes underpinning genome divergence in pathogenic bacteria. Here, we describe a synthesis between these perspectives by employing a recently developed Bayesian approach, BRATNextGen, for detecting recombination on an expanded NGS dataset of the globally disseminated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone ST239. The data confirm strong geographical clustering at continental, national and city scales and demonstrate that the rate of recombination varies significantly between phylogeographic sub-groups representing independent introductions from Europe. These differences are most striking when mobile non-core genes are included, but remain apparent even when only considering the stable core genome. The monophyletic ST239 sub-group corresponding to isolates from South America shows heightened recombination, the sub-group predominantly from Asia shows an intermediate level, and a very low level of recombination is noted in a third sub-group representing a large collection from Turkey. We show that the rapid global dissemination of a single pathogenic bacterial clone results in local variation in measured recombination rates. Possible explanatory variables include the size and time since emergence of each defined sub-population (as determined by the sampling frame), variation in transmission dynamics due to host movement, and changes in the bacterial genome affecting the propensity for recombination.",2016-01-17 16:50:31.324,2016-01-17 16:50:31.324,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"GCF_001226505.1_5197_1_3_genomic",0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices.",2016-01-17 16:04:55,2016-01-17 16:04:55,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"GCF_001018725.1_ASM101872v1_genomic",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
